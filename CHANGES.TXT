SI6 Networks' IPv6 Toolkit v1.4 release

   * frag6: Fixed the flooding option
     Fixed the fragment size used when employing the flooding option. It was 
     prevously sending fragment sizes that where not a multiple of eight, and
     hence these fragments were dropped.

   * scan6: Option "--tgt-ipv4" was augmented to support both encodings (32 bit
     and 64 bit) of embedded IPv4 addresses.

   * Many improvements to the manual pages.
     Fixed the troff encoding of many manual pages. Added ipv6toolkit(7), that
     describes a general description of the toolkit

   * All: Fixed bug in option handling
     Incorrect data type was used for the return value of getopt_long(), thus 
     leading to problems in some architectures

   * All: Fixed a number of issues with pcap_next_ex()
     The timeout parameter of pcap_next_ex() is now based on the platform (the
     previous constant value had different semantics in different platforms).
     Additionally, handle the case where pcap_next_ex() returns no packets.

   * All: General improvements and clean-up
     The development process now includes building the toolkit with the clang
     compiler (in addition to gcc), which has lead to the identification of a
     number of issues.

   * Improved support for building the toolkit. The toolkit now contains one
     makefile for pmake, and another for GNU make. Added support for the
     DESTDIR variable. Appropriate paths are selected based on the value of 
     a number of variables. Configuration file is dynamically generated,
     with the right path to the oui.txt file.
