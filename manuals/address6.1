.SH SYNOPSIS
.B address6
.RB [\| \-a
.IR IPV6_ADDR\| \ \-i]
.RB [\| \-q \|]
.RB [\| \-d \|]
.RB [\| \-s \|]
.RB [\| \-v \|]
.RB [\| \-h \|]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.B address6
is an IPv6 address analysis tool tool. It can employed identify the address type/scope, and infer the type of Interface ID employed by an IPv6 address. Additionally, the tool can filter lists of IPv6 addresses to eliminate duplicates, and can also produce statistics about a set of IPv6 addresses.

.SH OPTIONS
.B scan6
takes its parameters as command-line options. Each of the options can be specified with a short name (one character preceded with the hyphen character, as e.g. “\-i”) or with a long name (a string preceded with two hyphen characters, as e.g. “\-\-stdin”).


.TP
.BI -a\  IPV6_ADDRESS ,\ \-\-address\  IPV6_ADDRESS

This option ca be employed to specify a single IPv6 address that is meant to be processed by the tool. This option is typically employed in conjunction with the '-d' tool, to decode the IPv6 address in question.

.TP
.BR \-i ,\  \-\-stdin

This option request the tool to read IPv6 addresses from standard input (stdin), until an EOF (End-Of-File) condition is found.

.TP
.BR \-q ,\  \-\-print\-unique

This option causes the tool to eliminate duplicate addresses from the list of IPv6 addresses read from standard input (stdin). That is, when reading a list of addresses from stdin, only the first "copy" of each address will be processed by the tool (with later ones being simply ignored).

.TP
.BR \-d ,\  \-\-print\-decode

This option request the tool to decode the IPv6 address specfied with the '-a' option (or a list of addresses read froom stdin if the '-i' option was set). The amount of information printed for each address depends on the "verbosity" level (that can be increased with the '-v') option. The current version of this tool supports only one verbosity level. The information printed for each address will have the following format:

        AddressType=AddressSubtype=Scope=IIDTYpe=IIDSUbtype

.TP
.BR \-s\|  ,\  \-\-print\-stats

This option requests the tool to produce address statistics from the list of IPv6 addresses read from standard input. This option should be used in conjuction with the '-i' option.

.TP
.BR \-v\| ,\  \-\-verbose 

This option selects the “verbosity” of the tool. If this option is left unspecified, only minimum information is printed. 

.TP
.BR \-h\| ,\  \-\-help

Print help information for the 
.B address6
tool. 

.SH EXAMPLES

The following sections illustrate typical use cases of the
.B address6
tool.

\fBExample #1\fR

$ cat addresslist.txt | address6 -i -q

address6 will read IPv6 addresses from stdin ('-i' option), and will only print the first instance of each address ('-q' option), thus effectively removing any duplicates from the list.

    Note: In this particular scenario, the address list results
    from the command 'cat addresslist.txt', that has its output
    redirected to the standard input of the address6 tool.


\fBExample #2\fR

$ address6 -a fc00::1

Decode the IPv6 address spcified with the '-a' option. Note that while the '-d' option was not set, this is the default behavior of the tool (unless overriden y another option).


\fBExample #3\fR

$ cat addresslist.txt | address6 -i -q -s

address6 will read IPv6 addresses from stdin ('-i' option), will ignore duplicate addresses ('-q' option), and will print statistics about the processed IPv6 addresses.

    Note: In this particular scenario, the address list results
    from the command 'cat addresslist.txt', that has its output
    redirected to the standard input of the address6 tool.


\fBExample #4\fR

$ cat addresslist.txt | address6 -i -q -d

address6 will read IPv6 addresses from stdin ('-i' option), will ignore duplicate addresses ('-q' option), and will decode each of the remaining addresses.

    Note: In this particular scenario, the address list results
    from the command 'cat addresslist.txt', that has its output
    redirected to the standard input of the address6 tool.
